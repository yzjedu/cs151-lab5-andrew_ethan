The objective of this lab was to create a simulation of an ATM that allows users to view their balance, deposit funds, withdraw funds, and exit the program. We were expected to practice using loops, decision-making structures, and error handling while ensuring the program follows good usability principles.
Procedure:
I was away for the lab itself, due to a meeting, but Andrew would have most likely outlined the lab like this, for this algorithm:
1. Defined the main tasks (Deposit, Withdraw, View Balance, Exit).
2. Worked on the design process for the lab, accounting for all of the specified parts like error checking and loops. 
Key Concepts Explored:
* Loops
* We checked for invalid input (like negative amounts) and implemented warnings for overdrafts.
* We used if-elif-else statements to handle different user choices and program actions.
Results:
The program worked as expected and matched the expected outputs in all cases. We tested the program with a variety of inputs. The results were consistent with our expectations, and the error messages appeared appropriately.

Challenges Encountered:
One challenge we encountered was ensuring that the program correctly handled invalid inputs, such as non-numeric values for deposits and withdrawals. We also had to make sure the program didn't allow negative deposits or withdrawals larger than the balance without triggering a warning. 
Following the First 3 Rules of Programming:
1. Understand the Problem: Andrew took the time to fully understand the requirements of the ATM simulation, to create his algorithm. This involved identifying the key tasks the program needed to perform, such as depositing money, withdrawing money, checking the balance, and exiting the program. We also clarified the error-checking requirements for invalid inputs and overdrafts.
2. Design: We then designed a clear structure for the program, starting with a simple user interface that would allow the user to input commands. We planned the use of a loop to repeatedly prompt the user until they chose to exit, along with conditional statements to handle each option (Deposit, Withdraw, View Balance, and Exit). We also made sure to include error checking at every step.
3. Implement and Test: After I coded out the program, we thoroughly tested the program using different test cases, including valid and invalid inputs.
Overcoming Challenges:
We overcame the challenges by testing the program extensively with a wide range of inputs and refining the error-checking mechanisms. Working through test cases helped us identify bugs and fix them promptly.
Key Takeaways:
A key takeaway from this lab is the importance of error handling and ensuring user-friendly output. We learned how to manage loops effectively, and the practice with error checking will help in future programming tasks. 
Learning Outcomes:
I believe I learned what I was supposed to. This lab gave me a deeper understanding of how to structure programs that involve loops, decision-making, and error handling.
Working with Andrew:
Working with Andrew was a great experience. I was unable to be present for the lab itself, but we were able to connect really well, dividing tasks up, with him focusing more on the algorithm and design, and I focused on the programming and test cases. Overall, it was a smooth collaboration, and I look forward to working with him in the future!
